# Correct Branching Workflow for Issue #4

## Problem
The original issue was with PR #3 which fixed issue #2. The problem was:
- Issue #2 came from branch: `patch/oe-create-flutter-weather-app-with-login-and-location-based-wea`
- But the fix branch `copilot/fix-2` was created from `master`
- The PR #3 targeted `master` instead of the original branch

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Identified the Original Source
- Issue #2 originated from the branch `patch/oe-create-flutter-weather-app-with-login-and-location-based-wea`
- This branch contained `LoginScreen` with unused `_username` and `_password` fields

### 2. Created Correct Branch Structure
- Created new branch `copilot/fix-2-from-original-branch` 
- Applied the same fix that was in PR #3:
  - Removed unused `String _username = '';` field declaration
  - Removed unused `String _password = '';` field declaration  
  - Removed `onChanged` callbacks that assigned to these unused fields

### 3. Preserved Behavior
- Form validation still works correctly
- Users still need non-empty username and password
- Authentication flow remains unchanged

## Key Workflow Principle

**Always branch from the source where the issue originated, not from master.**

For issue #2:
- ✅ Correct: Create fix branch from `patch/oe-create-flutter-weather-app-with-login-and-location-based-wea`
- ✅ Correct: Target PR to `patch/oe-create-flutter-weather-app-with-login-and-location-based-wea`
- ❌ Incorrect: Create fix branch from `master` and target PR to `master`

This ensures the fix is applied to the development branch where the issue exists, maintaining proper git workflow.
